# Riley Training Module - New Features Added âœ…

## What's New

### 1. Riley Settings Tab
You can now configure Riley's default behavior, tone, and style directly in the training module:

**Settings Available:**
- **Default Tone:** Professional, Friendly, Casual, Formal, Enthusiastic, Empathetic

- **Max Response Length:** Control how long responses can be (50-500 tokens)

**Why This Matters:**
These settings are used by ChatGPT to generate responses. When you update these, Riley's personality and behavior will change accordingly across all conversations.

**Features:**
- **File Upload:** Drag and drop or select TXT, PDF, DOCX, CSV files (up to 5MB each)
