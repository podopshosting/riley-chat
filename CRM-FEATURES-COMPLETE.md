# Riley CRM - Complete Contact Management System ✅

## What's Been Built

I've created a complete CRM system for Riley with contacts management, lead tracking, Kanban boards, and automation capabilities.

## 🎯 Features Implemented

### 1. **Contact Management Database**
- **DynamoDB Tables Created:**
  - `riley-contacts` - All contact profiles with indexes for email, phone, and lead status
  - `riley-custom-fields` - Configurable custom fields
  - `riley-segments` - Contact segments and lists

### 2. **Kanban Board Lead Management**
Six lead status stages:
- 🆕 **New** - Fresh leads that haven't been contacted
- 📞 **Contacted** - Initial contact made
- 💬 **Engaged** - Active conversation happening
- 🎯 **Qualified** - Ready for sales
- ✅ **Won** - Converted to customer
- ❌ **Lost** - Not interested/lost opportunity

**Drag & drop functionality** - Move contacts between stages

### 3. **Contact Profiles with Full History**
Each contact profile includes:
- ✅ First Name, Last Name
- ✅ Email, Phone Number
- ✅ Lead Status (with dropdown)
- ✅ Tags (comma-separated, for categorization)
- ✅ Notes field
- ✅ Source tracking (SMS, Email, Web, Manual)
- ✅ Activity History Timeline
  - All conversations
  - Message history
  - Date/time stamps
  - Channel used (SMS/Email)
- ✅ Custom Fields (configurable)

### 4. **Dual View Modes**
- **📋 Kanban View** - Visual board for lead pipeline
- **📊 Table View** - Spreadsheet-style list with sorting

### 5. **Advanced Filtering & Segmentation**
- Filter by Segment
- Filter by Source (Manual, SMS, Email, Web)
- Search by Name, Email, or Phone
- Custom segment creation with conditions

### 6. **CRUD Operations**
Full contact lifecycle management:
- ✅ **Create** - Add new contacts manually
- ✅ **Read** - View full profile with activity

### 7. **Automatic Contact Creation**
Contacts are automatically created when:
- Someone sends an SMS to Riley

- Someone sends an email
- Manual entry by admin

### 8. **API Integration**
Complete REST API for CRM operations:
- `GET /contacts` - List all contacts with filters
