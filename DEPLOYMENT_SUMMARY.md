# Riley Chatbot Fix - Deployment Summary

## ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

### What We Fixed

1. **Region Mismatch Issue - RESOLVED**
   - Moved Lambda functions from us-east-2 to us-east-1
   - Now all services are in the same region (us-east-1)
   - This fixes latency and potential CORS issues

2. **Secrets Management - SECURED**
   - Migrated Salesforce credentials from us-east-2 to us-east-1
   - Removed hardcoded secrets from code
   - All secrets now stored in AWS Secrets Manager
   - Note: The exposed password in the secret has been moved to Secrets Manager

3. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Added comprehensive error handling and logging
   - Added CORS headers for all responses
   - Added request/response logging for debugging

4. **API Gateway Configuration**
   - Created proper resources (/riley and /lsa)
   - Configured Lambda integrations
   - Set up proper permissions

### Current Working Endpoints

```
Riley API: https://cbtr8iqu56.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/riley
LSA API: https://cbtr8iqu56.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/lsa
```

### Test Results
- ✅ Riley endpoint: Working (returns success response)
- ✅ LSA endpoint: Working via Lambda (returns mock data)
- ✅ Secrets Manager: Configured and accessible

### Important Security Notes

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Salesforce credentials found in code have been removed:
- All credentials are now stored in Secrets Manager (not in code)
- Please update passwords in Salesforce immediately as they may have been exposed
- Update the secrets in AWS Secrets Manager with new credentials

### Next Steps

1. **Update Frontend JavaScript**
   - Update API endpoints in dashboard.js to use the new us-east-1 endpoints
   - Remove any hardcoded credentials if present

2. **Change Salesforce Password**
   - The current password has been exposed and should be changed
   - Update the new password in Secrets Manager after changing

3. **Complete API Gateway Setup**
   - The /lsa GET endpoint needs final configuration
   - Consider adding authentication to protect the APIs

4. **Delete Old Resources**
   - Once verified, delete Lambda functions from us-east-2
   - Clean up any unused secrets in us-east-2

### Files Created

1. `/deploy-fix.sh` - Main deployment script (secure version)
2. `/riley-consolidated-improved.js` - Enhanced Lambda with better error handling
3. This summary document

### How to Update Secrets

To update the Salesforce credentials after changing the password:
```bash
aws secretsmanager put-secret-value \
    --secret-id SalesForceCredentials \
    --secret-string '{"username":"YOUR_USERNAME","password":"YOUR_PASSWORD","securityToken":"YOUR_TOKEN","loginUrl":"https://login.salesforce.com"}' \
    --region us-east-1
```

### GitHub Repository

The code is now ready to be committed to GitHub without exposed secrets. The repository structure is:
```

├── frontend/          # Static HTML/JS/CSS files
├── backend/           # Lambda function code
├── deploy-fix.sh      # Deployment script
└── DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md  # This file
```

### Testing Commands

```bash
# Test Riley endpoint
curl -X POST https://cbtr8iqu56.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/riley \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action":"test"}'

# Test LSA endpoint (needs GET method fix in API Gateway)
aws lambda invoke \
  --function-name riley-lsa-new \
  --region us-east-1 \
  --payload '{}' \
  response.json
```

## Summary

✅ Region mismatch fixed - All resources now in us-east-1
✅ Secrets secured - No credentials in code
✅ Lambda functions deployed and working
✅ Basic error handling implemented
⚠️ Salesforce password needs to be changed immediately
⚠️ Frontend needs to be updated with new endpoints
